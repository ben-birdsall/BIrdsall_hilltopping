# BIrdsall_hilltopping
This model (birdsall_hilltop_final) functions as a basic concept illustrating butterflies using travel corridors for movement to find mates at higher elevations. 
There are 3 distinct aspects to the model: landscape, population, and movement. Landscape is the creation of a hilltop simmulating the environment that butterflies would be located in. Population denotes the function within the model that populates a total of fifty butterflies on the landscape in a clustered position. Movement is a function that determines if and where butterflies move to along the landscape. 
The code for this model should be ran as a whole. Each individual aspect (i.e. landscape, population, and movement) can be run seperately, however it is best to run the entire code as a whole. 
Corridors do seem to emerge, as evidenced by the final heat map which shows the formation of travel corridors. 
In the repository under 'final figure' is the heat map illustrating the movement corridors. 

**of note** I was not able to fully debug my code, when ran as is the majority of the time the model runs, however during a select few occasions the model will give an error code of "subscript out of bounds. W
  When this occurs I clear the environment and run it again.
